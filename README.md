# Welcome to D8 Services

Our team of engineers deliver technical solutions to organisations across APAC. As such we develop some in house scripts that can help other Apple/macOS admins.

If you feel that we have helped you out, all we ask is that you give us a little credit in our scripts and understand that with Apple moving as quickly as it does, some scripts may need tweaking as time moves on. We get that having to modify the script means you have forked the code, but we do the same.

Feel free to buy us a coffee if you feel like it, every bit helps.
